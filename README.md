# hyperlift back-end

Exercise work for [Fullstackopen 2021 MOOC course](https://fullstackopen.com/).

# The structure of the back-end

On the barebone, the back-end uses Node.js with Express and Apollo server. For data storage the back-end uses MongoDB that is implemented with the help of Typegoose. As for testing, I created a separate collection in the MongoDB that was used specifically for testing purposes. Testing was done with the help of Jest library.
